====== Instances ======

Instances are what replace "worlds" from Minecraft vanilla. Instances are lightweight and should offer similar properties

They can be accessed by using the InstanceManager or by getting an entity instance

--------------------
InstanceManager instanceManager = MinecraftServer.getInstanceManager()
// Or
Entity#getInstance
--------------------

There are two kinds of instance: InstanceContainer and SharedInstance

An InstanceContainer contains both chunks and entities, a SharedInstance needs to share chunks with its container.

You can create an InstanceContainer by calling:

--------------------
InstanceContainer instanceContainer = instanceManager.createInstanceContainer();
--------------------

And a SharedInstance using:
--------------------
SharedInstance sharedInstance = instanceManager.createSharedInstance(instanceContainer);
--------------------

Instances do need to have a ChunkGenerator specified, without it no chunk can be generated.

--------------------
instance.setChunkGenerator(YOUR_GENERATOR);
--------------------

It is also important to notice that, by default, the chunks of the instance are only stored in memory. In order to have them stored in a persistent way, you need to specify a "StorageFolder" and to save manually.
